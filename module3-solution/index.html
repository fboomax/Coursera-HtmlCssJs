              In “Atomic War or Peace,” Albert Einstein wrote: “The release of
              atomic energy has not created anew problem. It has merely made
              more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one. “One could
              say that it has affected us quantitatively, not qualitatively. As
              long as there are sovereign nations possessing great power, war is
              inevitable. “That is not an attempt to say when it will come,but
              only that it is sure to come. That was true before the atomic bomb
              was made. What has been changed is the destructiveness of war.” In
